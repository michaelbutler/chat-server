# chat-server

A simple chat server -- one server, N-many clients -- written in different languages as a learning
exercise. All code was also written using NeoVim to learn that software as well.

One desired goal is to have all versions of the client be compatible with all versions (programming
languages) of the server. For example, a Go client connecting to a Python server, or the Rust client 
connecting to the Java server.
